    "text": "LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n\n\n\n\nHey there!\nMy name is Alexis Heath, but Lex is just fine. I am a current 2nd year Systems Biology and Bioinformatics PhD student at Case Western Reserve University in Dr. Doug Brubaker’s lab. My research interests primarily lie in using multi-omic and network-based approaches to explore estrogen signaling in endometriosis.\nI graduated summa cum laude from Bowling Green State University in May of 2023, completing a B.S. with Honors in Biology and with a minor in Chemistry. While there, through seemingly countless hours of counting cells and twiddling with finicky cultures, I somehow discovered a love for scientific research and the community.\nCurrently, my thesis work involves exploring the role of the cervicovaginal microbiome on local estrogen signaling in the reproductive tract as well as creating tissue- and cell-type specific nuclear estrogen receptor expression derived gene regulatory networks in endometriosis and non-disease states. I hope that this work will bring new insights to the field of endometriosis research to improve diagnostic and treatment options. Though my current work is in human health, my past research experience under Dr. Christopher Ward, Dr. George Bullerjahn, & the SULI program was in environmental microbiology, revolving around harmful algal blooms, soil microbiomes, and carbon cycling, and I’m especially grateful for their guidance.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my published works, updates on my current research projects, and other tidbits about me. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about me and my work: please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects!"

Though estimated to affect at least 1 in 10 reproductive-age women, the causes are not understood, and there are no effective treatment methods. To fill this knowledge gap, I am characterizing the relationship between cervicovaginal microbiome components and local estrogen signaling along with nuclear estrogen receptor expression-derived gene regulatory networks. Aim 1 of my study will determine cervicovaginal microbiome-derived regulators of local estrogen signaling in the endometrium. Aim 2 of my study will delineate tissue- and cell-type specific estrogen receptor isoform expression derived gene regulatory networks in people with and without endometriosis."

I analyzed the pooled estimates to quantify the association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and the risk of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) acquisition. This involved evaluating heterogeneity across studies, performing subgroup analyses to explore potential moderators, and assessing publication bias to ensure the robustness of the findings. My work provided the quantitative foundation for the study’s conclusions and implications for public health interventions aimed at reducing sexually transmitted infection risks in women."

This study investigates how shifts in cervicovaginal microbial composition and function may disrupt key signaling pathways, like estrogen and progesterone signaling, essential for implantation. Using scRNAseq and multi-omic data, the project seeks to identify microbial species, microbiome-derived metabolites, and microbial peptides that correlate with implantation success or failure, shedding light on potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets. This research aims to deepen our understanding of the microbiome’s systemic impact, ultimately informing interventions to improve implantation outcomes in individuals experiencing RIF."

In each treatment, there was a range of ten temperatures spanning from 18°C to 30°C (around 1.5 degrees difference between temperatures). For each temperature, six cultures were in separate 50 mL Falcon tubes to account for any contamination, and the tubes could eventually be averaged for better accuracy and precision. My primary role was to monitor and maintain the gas tanks and constant bubbling of the cultures and collect cell samples every other day. I performed all cell counts with a hemocytometer slide and analyzed all of my collected data. I received a CURS grant from BGSU for my work on the project.
